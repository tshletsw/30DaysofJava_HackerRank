Task
Given a string, s, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1 , 
print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

Example
s = abcdef
Print abc def

The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases).
Each line i  of the T subsequent lines contain a string, s.
